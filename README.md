# Ukraine

I created an interactive map of the Ukrainian/Russian war using the Leaflet package (leaflet.R). I also created a predictive model using the caret package (initiator_prediction.R). This repo has the base code I used to create the maps which were then trasnlated into a Shiny app (Ukraine_War_App directory). I haven't included the model in the shiy app yet but that's a work in progress.
